RisikoAI implements the rules of the boardgame Risk and offers an interface to an ai player. Currently there are 3 very basic ai players implemented.

To start hacking your own ai follow these steps:

1. Download a <a href="http://www.qt.io/download-open-source/">QT5 version</a> and install (Remember to set QTDIR)
2. Download <a href="http://www.cmake.org/">CMake</a> and install
3. Create a new project dir (e.g. c:\projects\exampleProjectName)
4. Download the source to your project dir (c:\projects\exampleProjectName\RisikoAI)
5. Create a build directory (c:\projects\exampleProjectName\build)
6. Use CMake to configure your build environment (Tested with VS2013)
7. Compile your solution
8. Call <exampleProjectName>\RisikoAI\DeployQT.bat
9. Find an executable in <exampleProjectName>\install\
10. Play around with RiskAISimple and try to kill TitanNet!
